# Exprofin 2023 
Welcome back! <br>
For this project I collaborated with different people from different majors in order to make a **presentation website** for a Chemistry project at my University's event: "Exprofin". An academic competition where students team up and develop innovative projects across different academic areas.<br>
My role in this project was to **gather information about the requirements from each participant**, from the chemistry engineers to the accountant and business administrators; each person was to present different parts of the project, so I had to understand what they did, what they needed for the presentation day and how would I incorporate that into the website.
